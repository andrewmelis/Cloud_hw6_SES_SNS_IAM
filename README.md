 Due week 7 before class, via Chalk email. 
 Use the SES console to verify an email account and send email to yourself.
 Copy this email, including all headers, and submit it as part 1 of your homework assignment. For example, if you use gmail, select the "Show Original" option to see the headers.
 Use the SNS console to create an topic called "51083-HW6-<your name>" and subscribe to it via email. 
 Copy this email, including all headers, and submit it as part 2 of your homework assignment. For example, if you use gmail, select the "Show Original" option to see the headers.
 Adopt better identity and access management practices.
 If you have not done so already, create an admin user. See pp. 22ff of the IAM User Guide.
 Going forward, use the admin user and NOT your AWS account credentials. 
 There is no assignment to hand in for part 3.
 If you're disappointed that the homework is so light and you want something else to try:
 Experiment with creating users with variously restricted access and having them run your scripts from earlier weeks. Build error handlers with appropriate messages.
 Experiment with command line or SDK control of SES, SNS, and IAM.
